  On the Courseware page you will find the individual and collaborative portions of the math test as well as a demographic survey.
</p>

<p>
  The test questions require numerical responses. Fractions can be written using "/", but no letters are permitted. Once you have decided on an answer, press the "check" button and navigate to the next question.
</p>

<p>
  To answer the questions, you can use the calculator widget that appears at the bottom of the test or your own calculator. You may also want to use paper and a pencil.
</p>


<p>
Don't spend too long on any one question, and remember that <strong>all questions must be answered </strong>. If you have to guess, that is OK.

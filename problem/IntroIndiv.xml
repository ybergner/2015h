This is the individual portion of the math test. 
Please complete this part first before moving on the the collaborative part.
We ask that you make your best effort to respond to all of the questions. 
If you do not know the answer, it is okay to guess.

<p>
To answer the questions, you can use the calculator widget that appears at the bottom of the test or your own calculator. 
You may also want to use paper and a pencil.
The test questions require numerical responses. 
Fractions can be written using "/" (as in "1/4"), but no letters are permitted.
